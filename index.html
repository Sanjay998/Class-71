                <p class="text-muted text-left">When President Theodore Roosevelt encountered Yellowstone's wondrous geology and abundant animals during a visit to America's first national park in 1903, he proclaimed it “absolutely unique in the world.” Embracing natural beauty as a shared asset, he championed the idea of national parks, building a priceless legacy for generations to follow. In the northwest corner of Wyoming, two of America's most treasured parks offer scenic grandeur and prolific wildlife unparalleled in the Lower 48, with outstanding opportunities for nature photography. This classic small-group safari through Yellowstone and the Tetons takes us into the domain of elk and bison, moose, bighorn sheep, coyotes, foxes, bald eagles and, of course, black bears, grizzlies and wolves. From plains to peaks, Yellowstone Country still works strong magic.</p>

                <p class="text-muted text-left">Grand Canyon National Park, in Arizona, is home to much of the immense Grand Canyon, with its layered bands of red rock revealing millions of years of geological history. Viewpoints include Mather Point, Yavapai Observation Station and architect Mary Colter’s Lookout Studio and her Desert View Watchtower. Lipan Point, with wide views of the canyon and Colorado River, is a popular, especially at sunrise and sunset.</p>

                <p class="text-muted text-left">Home of the world’s tallest trees, this World Heritage Site and International Biosphere Reserve protects nearly half of the world’s old growth redwoods, including champion specimens more than 370 feet (113 meters) in height—or five stories taller than the Statue of Liberty. Walk, bike, camp or horseback ride along 200 miles of trails in the park system, which in a unique state/federal partnership includes Jedediah Smith Redwoods, Del Norte Coast Redwoods, and Prairie Creek Redwoods State Parks. The park’s forests, hills, rivers and coastline support a rich mosaic of life, including Roosevelt Elk, whales, seals and seasonal wildflowers such as lupine and rhododendron. The sprawling park system also provides many opportunities for scenic drives.</p>

                <p>As promised, Avengers: Infinity War is very much a Thanos movie. The big purple CGI villain (played by Josh Brolin in a mo-cap performance) commands perhaps the strongest arc of the film. If we can’t empathize with his reasoning for wanting to wipe out half of the universe’s inhabitants – the highest stakes ever for the Avengers, which are effectively established throughout the movie – we can at least understand his perspective and believe his pain when he must make true sacrifices to achieve his ultimate goal. Zoe Saldana’s Gamora and Karen Gillan’s Nebula play a larger part in this film than one might’ve expected. That the origin story of Gamora, and Thanos to a certain degree, have such a prominent role in a movie called “Avengers” is a refreshing surprise, and getting a glimpse at what Gamora endured as a child is a fairly remarkable moment as we witness the insidious power of Thanos at his twisted worst. In this, a tale of awful abuse emerges. Then again, much of Infinity War dwells in the murky area between what it has promised, and what it wants to surprise us with. Yes, many of our expectations are satisfied, but at the same time there are curveballs thrown that will keep viewers guessing. The film is all the stronger for it, as it consistently subverts the expectations it sets up for the audience.</p>

                <p>In the engaging animated feature “Wish Dragon,” a teenage boy comes into possession of a magic teapot containing a world-weary dragon who’s obliged to grant him three wishes. The movie is geared toward children, but for anyone old enough to remember the Disney Renaissance, there should be a déjà vu warning: Netflix’s newest animation effort is essentially Disney’s “Aladdin” transposed to Shanghai. John Cho, who voices Long, the dragon, does his best impression of Robin Williams, who lent his voice to the fast-talking Genie in the 1992 Disney animation. But without the catchy songs and intergenerational appeal, this movie can only wish to measure up to that classic.</p>

                <p>Excellent movie which I would cherish all through my life. The whole movie is well scripted with screenplay smoothly flowing like a river. The narrators have given life to the characters through their graceful voices. This movie was a benchmark for all the animated cartoons featured later in the history of films. The movie revolves around the emotions of father lion towards its cub and vice versa. This movie is definitely one among st the favorites of 90's kids. I was really moved and touched by the climax sequence and the scene where the dad lion will be assassinated.Though there are sequels made, my favorite still remains this one.</p>

                    The fires that raged across the Brazilian Amazon this summer were not 'normal' and large increases in deforestation could explain why, scientists show. The perceived scale of the Amazon blazes received global attention this summer. However, international concerns raised at the time were countered by the Brazilian Government, which claimed the fire situation in August was 'normal' and 'below the historical average'. An international team of scientists writing in the journal Global Change Biology say the number of active fires in August was actually three times higher than in 2018 and the highest number since 2010.
